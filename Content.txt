We searched for our shop renovation and selected this guy. Basically this guy accepted the work and promised the date to finish his works. And I paid 20k to finish the first phase. He started the first phase and completed 50 percent of the works. Then I paid 25k to start very soon for second phase of the works. After that he is postponing the works consistently and also all others works was done by other team. But this ACP cladding work is still not completed. So that I unable to open the shop on time what we informed to my customers. That is really very bad experience. 

And after that I called him continuously and he told me to quit this project and refunding the money. But still he is not refundinguring the money.

He completed only 50 percent of the first phase(ms work)
Other three phases are not completed

Total estimated is 95k
I paid 45k
42.k by GPAY and 2.5k by CASH

Recently I chat him to refund, but no use.
